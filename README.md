1. Error Handling - Project to use configuration files to review any tickets closed in specific Qualtrics brands since the jobs last run time for X given surveys. For those tickets, the script compares that data to the associated survey responses to validate data completeness and accuracy. The purpose of this script is to validate the accuracy and success rates of the Qualtrics PUT Update Response API that passes data between Surveys and Tickets using Web Service Actions, saving manual hours needed to review the data.
